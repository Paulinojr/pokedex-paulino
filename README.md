## React Pokédex

This is a simple react pokédex application.
The most special thing about it is that it lists all the 151 original Pokémon, the good ones. Just kidding, I'm not that conservative regarding Pokémon quality, generation 2 and 3 also had great designed pokémon like Chikorita
and Treecko, and I didn't actually followed what came after this so I can't really tell about newer generations, it would be unfair. Like reviewing an album without listening to it, or criticizing a movie without seeing it, or even analyzing that vegan restaurant before actually eating it's food and so on.

Despite of that, here's how to make the application run:

## Running the app

Clone this repo with:

``` git clone https://github.com/Paulinojr/pokedex-paulino.git ```

Access the folder and install dependencies with:

``` cd pokedex-paulino ```

``` npm install ```

And finally, run the following command:

``` npm run start ```

You should see the application in your browser.

Hope you like this. Thank you!
